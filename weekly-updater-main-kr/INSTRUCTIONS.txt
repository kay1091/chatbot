# Opportunity Data Consolidator - Setup and Usage Instructions

This application allows you to upload Salesforce and Frontend opportunity data from Excel files and view a consolidated, sorted list.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js:** You need Node.js installed on your system. Version 14.x or higher is recommended. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). Verify your installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running:
    ```
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```
2.  **Excel Files:** Prepare your Salesforce and Frontend data in separate `.xlsx` files. Ensure the columns match those expected by the application (specifically the SFID columns: 'Opportunity ID' for Salesforce, 'SFID' for Frontend).

## Setup

1.  **Navigate to Project Directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing this `INSTRUCTIONS.txt` file and the `frontend-app` folder.
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/karthilk-sfdc 
    ```
    (Replace `/path/to/karthilk-sfdc` with the actual path on your system)

2.  **Install Dependencies:** Navigate into the `frontend-app` directory and install the required Node.js packages.
    ```bash
    cd frontend-app
    npm install
    ```
    This might take a few minutes.

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Development Server:** While inside the `frontend-app` directory, run the start command:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
2.  **Access the App:** This will usually open the application automatically in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. If not, open your browser and navigate to that address.

## Usage

1.  **Upload Files:**
    *   Click the "Upload Salesforce Data" tab and use the file input to select your Salesforce `.xlsx` file.
    *   Click the "Upload Frontend Data" tab and use the file input to select your Frontend `.xlsx` file.
    *   You will see confirmation messages once the files are processed.
2.  **View Consolidated Data:**
    *   Click the "Consolidated View" tab.
    *   The table will display all rows from both uploaded files, sorted by the most relevant date found ('Close Date', 'Created Date', or 'Due Date') in descending order (newest first).
3.  **Download Data:**
    *   On the "Consolidated View" tab, click the "Download Consolidated View" button to download the displayed data as an `.xlsx` file.
4.  **Clear Data:**
    *   On the "Consolidated View" tab, click the "Clear All Data" button to remove all uploaded data from the application's memory (you will need to re-upload files).

## Stopping the Application

*   Go back to the terminal where `npm start` is running and press `Ctrl + C`.
